Railway Deployment
1. Create a new Railway project
Go to Railway and sign in
Click "New Project"
Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo" or "Empty Project"
2. Deploy the code
If using GitHub:

Push this code to a GitHub repository
Connect the repository to Railway
Railway will automatically detect and deploy
If using empty project:

Use Railway CLI or upload files directly
3. Set Environment Variables
In your Railway project dashboard, add these environment variables:

SSH_USERNAME: Your SSH username (default: user)
SSH_PASSWORD: Your SSH password (default: railway123)
PORT: Railway will set this automatically
4. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)
In Railway dashboard, go to your service
Click "Settings" > "Domains"
Add a custom domain or use the generated Railway domain
Connecting from Android Termux
Install SSH client in Termux
bash
pkg update
pkg install openssh
Connect to your SSH server
bash
ssh -p 2222 user@your-app-name.up.railway.app
Replace:

user with your SSH_USERNAME
your-app-name.up.railway.app with your Railway domain
Use the password you set in SSH_PASSWORD
Example connection
bash
ssh -p 2222 user@myapp-production-1234.up.railway.app
Security Notes
⚠️ Important Security Considerations:

Change Default Credentials: Always change the default username and password
Use Strong Passwords: Use a strong, unique password
Consider Key-Based Auth: For production use, implement SSH key authentication
Network Security: Railway provides HTTPS, but consider additional security measures
Monitor Access: Check Railway logs for unauthorized access attempts
Available Commands
Once connected via SSH, you can use standard Linux commands:

ls - List files
pwd - Print working directory
cat - Display file contents
nano - Edit files
curl - Make HTTP requests
git - Git operations
node - Run Node.js scripts
npm - Node package manager
Troubleshooting
Connection Refused
Check if Railway service is running
Verify the domain name is correct
Ensure port 2222 is being used
Authentication Failed
Verify username and password in Railway environment variables
Check Railway logs for authentication attempts
Terminal Issues
Try different terminal types: ssh -o "RequestTTY=yes" -p 2222 user@domain
Use specific terminal: TERM=xterm ssh -p 2222 user@domain
Development
Local Development
bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables (optional)
export SSH_USERNAME=testuser
export SSH_PASSWORD=testpass
export PORT=2222

# Run the server
npm start
Connect locally
bash
ssh -p 2222 testuser@localhost
